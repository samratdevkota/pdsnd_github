### Project Title
Project: Explore The US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
#### Software requirement:
- You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

#### You'll need the three dataset files
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv



### Credits
I want to thank Udacity, Mentors, and my Parents.
